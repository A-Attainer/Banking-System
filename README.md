# Banking-System
This code implements a basic banking system using python, where customers can perform various operations such as opening or closing accounts, depositing or withdrawing money, viewing their account details, and checking recent transactions. The main functionalities are implemented in separate functions, with main() serving as the user interface that repeatedly prompts the user for actions until they choose to exit.
